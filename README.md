# personal_website
This website, coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, serves as my future professional portfolio and contact hub. It will showcase my future projects and provide a means to connect with me. Have fun exploring my work!

As of Sep 11, 2023, the files contained are yet to be hosted on a live server and are still under development. The frontend of the website is essentially completed, with a couple of bug fixes needed for the contact form. On the other hand, the backend nodemailer function to send contact emails needs to be implemented and finalized. The photography page is still under development as of now. 

Todo:
1. fix contact form input bug
2. implement nodemailer function
3. figure out how to host website
